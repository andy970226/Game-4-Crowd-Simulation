Set the public parameters of object "TrafficControl" to adjust number of agents(2-50 is ok) and "ObsCtrl" to adjust number of obstacles (better less than 7, or may fall into endless loop).

There are no signs of the heads and tails for agents but they actually have. They only go back when they face an obstacle.

It runs well. See Stat.pdf for question analysis.
